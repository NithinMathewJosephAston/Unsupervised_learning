# Unsupervised_learning

Task 1:

The file cluster1.csv contains 500 data points. Each data point has two features.

Using Python, apply k-means to partition the data set into three clusters. Plot a graph of the 
resulting clusters.

Your (fictional) colleague claims to have done the above multiple times. 
They claim that in their experience, k-means always converges quickly on this dataset and that
the graphs that they get after each run of the algorithm (with different random seeds) show 
very similar clusters. They say that this shows that the three clusters found with k-means 
are the best possible clusters within this dataset. Do you agree with your colleague? Justify
your answer based on your graph, and on your understanding of the k-means algorithm

Task 2:

The file cluster2.csv contains 1000 data points. Each data point has two features. You do not
know anything about how many clusters to expect in this data. You also do not know whether the
k-means algorithm or a GMM would be the best way to cluster this dataset.

Based on the principles discussed in lectures, design a methodology to choose an appropriate 
model and number of clusters for this dataset. Implement your methodology using Python. 
Explain your methodology and justify your choice of model and number of clusters. You may 
want to produce graphs to help support some aspects of this justification
